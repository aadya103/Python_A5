# Assignment 5  
This repository contains solutions for two tasks from Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python. The program is written in two Python files, Task 1 and Task 2.

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks  
The program creates a dictionary where student names are used as keys and their marks as values. It prompts the user to enter a studentâ€™s name and retrieves the corresponding marks. If the student is not found in the dictionary, an appropriate message is displayed.

### Sample Input/Output (If student is found)  
```sh
Enter the student's name: Alice  
Alice's marks: 85
```

### Sample Input/Output (If student is not found)  
```sh
Enter the student's name: John  
Student not found.
```

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing  
The program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10. It then slices out the first five elements from the list and reverses those elements. Finally, it prints both the extracted list and the reversed version of that list.

### Sample Output  
```sh
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  
First five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Reversed first five elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
